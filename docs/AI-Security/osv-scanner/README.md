# AI Security Tutorials — TopFlow GitHub Security Scanner

A hands-on cybersecurity / AI-security training series built from **real hardening work** on
TopFlow's LLM workflow engine and its flagship GitHub Security Scanner. Each tutorial turns a
shipped pull request into a teaching case study: you see the threat, the model, the attack, the
design trade-offs, and the actual code that fixed it.

> These are training materials. They reference real files and PRs in this repository so learners
> can read the production code alongside the lesson.

## Who this is for
Application & platform engineers, security engineers, and AI/ML engineers shipping LLM-powered
products. Comfort with TypeScript and basic web security is assumed; each tutorial recaps the
concepts it depends on.

## How each tutorial is structured
A consistent template so the series compounds:

1. **Context & architecture** — where the risk lives in this system.
2. **Security mechanism** — the defensive concept(s), in general terms.
3. **Threat model** — assets, trust boundaries, entry points, STRIDE mapping for *this* architecture.
4. **Attack trees** — attacker goals decomposed into concrete paths (incl. the ones we did *not* fully close).
5. **Design considerations** — the decisions and trade-offs, with the roads not taken.
6. **Implementation case study** — a walkthrough of the real PR: code, tests, what was deferred and why.
7. **Hands-on labs & exercises** — do/observe/break, plus discussion questions.
8. **Takeaways, mappings & further reading** — OWASP / CWE / NIST / MITRE references and a checklist.

| # | Topic | Source | Status | Published |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | Securing workflow egress & execution: SSRF allowlisting, cycle detection, rate limiting | PR #12 | Draft 2026-06-14 | [topflow.dev/blog/01-ssrf-cycle-detection-rate-limiting](https://topflow.dev/blog/01-ssrf-cycle-detection-rate-limiting) |
| 02 | Secrets at rest: BYOK key encryption in a zero-backend app | W1 key-encryption | Draft 2026-06-14 | [topflow.dev/blog/02-secrets-at-rest-byok-encryption](https://topflow.dev/blog/02-secrets-at-rest-byok-encryption) |
| 03 | JS-node sandbox isolation: replacing `new Function()` with a real isolate | W1-T3 | Not started — blocked | pending T3 dep (`quickjs-emscripten`; frozen-lockfile PR required) |
| 04 | Durable rate limiting: from in-memory to Redis/KV across serverless instances | W1-T4 | Draft 2026-06-14 | [topflow.dev/blog/04-durable-rate-limiting-upstash-redis](https://topflow.dev/blog/04-durable-rate-limiting-upstash-redis) |
| 05 | The Untrusted Reasoning Worker: constraining LLMs on security/compliance paths | W2 Phase 1 | Draft 2026-06-14 | [topflow.dev/blog/05-untrusted-reasoning-worker](https://topflow.dev/blog/05-untrusted-reasoning-worker) |

**Tutorial → implementation mapping:** each tutorial is written once the corresponding code lands. Tutorial 03 is blocked until the `quickjs-emscripten` dep-add PR merges. Tutorials 01, 02, 04, and 05 are complete drafts. Tutorial 05 was drafted alongside W2 Phase 1 shipment — no new deps required.

See `docs/development/osv-scanner/05-implementation-status.md` for the live implementation tracker (what's shipped, what's blocked, what's next).

## Companion design docs
