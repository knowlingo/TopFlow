1. Disable service_account_03 immediately
2. Block outbound traffic to IP 185.234.xxx.xxx
3. Terminate active database connections from compromised account
4. Enable enhanced logging on all database servers

Long-term:
1. Reset all service account credentials
2. Implement IP allowlisting for service accounts
3. Deploy DLP solution to prevent future exfiltration

PHASE 4 - ERADICATION:
• Review all service account activity for past 30 days
• Scan for additional compromised accounts
• Patch any identified vulnerabilities

PHASE 5 - RECOVERY:
• Restore normal operations with enhanced monitoring
• Implement additional security controls
• Verify no backdoors remain`

□ Isolate affected database server DB-PROD-01 [PENDING]
□ Preserve forensic evidence - snapshot system state [PENDING]
□ Enable verbose audit logging on all critical systems [IN PROGRESS]
□ Notify incident response team via PagerDuty [COMPLETED]

2. ERADICATION PROCEDURES (15-60 minutes):
□ Conduct forensic analysis of compromised account activity
□ Identify and remove any persistence mechanisms
□ Reset credentials for all service accounts
□ Apply security patches if vulnerability exploited
□ Review and revoke suspicious API tokens
□ Scan for additional indicators of compromise

3. RECOVERY ACTIONS (1-4 hours):
□ Restore services with enhanced monitoring
□ Implement temporary additional access controls
□ Deploy honeypot accounts for detection
□ Increase SOC monitoring level to HIGH
□ Conduct integrity checks on affected data
□ Prepare breach notification if required

4. LESSONS LEARNED TEMPLATE:
• Incident Timeline: [Document all events with timestamps]
• Root Cause: [Compromised service account - investigate how]
• Detection Gap: [Why wasn't this caught earlier?]
• Response Effectiveness: [What worked, what didn't?]
• Preventive Measures: [Specific controls to implement]
• Process Improvements: [Updates to IR procedures]

COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS:
• GDPR: 72-hour notification to supervisory authority
• CCPA: Notification without unreasonable delay
• State Laws: Check breach notification requirements

COMMUNICATION PLAN:
• Internal: All-hands meeting at 10:00 UTC
• External: Prepare customer notification (legal review required)
• Media: Statement prepared by communications team`
